## Personal Reflection

Learning Ruby on Rails was challenging but surprisingly easy to get into. The framework's conventions and tools made it straightforward to pick up and productive to use quickly. The project also highlighted the importance of user experience. Developing a habit tracker required the app to be both functional and engaging. I focused on creating an intuitive interface and an enjoyable overall experience for users.

I gained experience with routing, setting up nested routes, and using route helpers for smooth navigation. Working with ERB templates and partials helped me maintain a clean and reusable code. Handling forms and validations helped emphasizing the importance of data integrity through model validations. Implementing CRUD operations across the app gave me practical web development skills, boosting my web skills and css integration to develop better UI.
